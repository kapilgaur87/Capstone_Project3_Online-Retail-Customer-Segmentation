# Capstone_Project4_Online-Retail-Customer-Segmentation
Unsupervised machine learning (ML) is a subclass of ML that allows for the discovery of links and patterns in data without the use of explicit labelling or human supervision. Unsupervised learning's goal is to find structure and patterns in data sets without any prior understanding of what those patterns might be.

The goal of this project is to identify important client segments.

Customer segmentation is the process of dividing a clientele into various categories according to their characteristics, behaviours, or demographics. This helps businesses to tailor their messaging, create focused marketing campaigns, and improve the customer experience.

There are several ways to segment clients, including:

Dividing up the customer base depending on factors including age, gender, income, education, and employment. Geographically based consumer segmentation, such as a customer's nation, area, city, or postal code. Psychographic segmentation is the split of a customer base based on traits such as personality, values, beliefs, and lifestyle. Segmenting customers based on their purchasing habits, frequency of purchases, brand loyalty, and product usage. By segmenting their customer base, businesses can better understand the needs and preferences of different customer groups, and they can then tailor their marketing strategies to meet those needs. A business might, for instance, create different marketing campaigns for distinct age groups or geographic regions, or it might offer specific product recommendations based on previous customer purchases.

Customer segmentation can be carried either manually by looking at customer data or automatically using machine learning algorithms based on data trends. Regardless of the technique used, customer segmentation is a beneficial tool for businesses to improve their marketing operations and provide better customer experiences.
